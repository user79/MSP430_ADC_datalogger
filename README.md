# MSP430_ADC_datalogger

This is a deliberately simple example that reads voltages from a MSP430G2553 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and sends those readings to a computer connected by a serial port (e.g. to PuTTY).  It can be used as the basis for many other projects.

To compile it, you can create a new C project in Code Composer Studio, then paste this code into the provided sample main.c file.
